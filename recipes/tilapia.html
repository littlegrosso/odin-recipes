    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>A quick 15-minute recipe for pan-seared tilapia that's delicious and full of flavor. </p>

    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 (4ounce) tilapia fillets</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>

    <h2>STEPS</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off any excess.</li>
